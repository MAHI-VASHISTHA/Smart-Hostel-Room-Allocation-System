Smart Hostel Room Allocation System is a Java-based desktop application designed to manage hostel rooms and automatically allocate the most suitable room to students based on capacity and facility requirements. The project demonstrates strong use of object-oriented programming, clean separation of logic, and an interactive graphical user interface.

Frontend Technologies Used:
The frontend is built using Java Swing and AWT, providing a desktop-based GUI with components such as JFrame, JTable, JTextField, JCheckBox, JButton, JTabbedPane, and JTextArea for smooth user interaction and usability.

Backend Technologies Used:
The backend logic is implemented using Core Java, including OOP concepts like classes, objects, constructors, and methods. The Java Collections Framework (ArrayList, List) is used for data storage, while Java Streams API and Comparator are used for filtering, searching, and sorting rooms efficiently.
